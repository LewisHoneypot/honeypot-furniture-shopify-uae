The delivery charge is non-refundable once the item has been despatched from our warehouse. If you miss a delivery, you will have to pay the delivery fee again. If you return your item for a refund, your delivery fee cannot be refunded, additionally, if you reject the delivery the delivery fee cannot be refunded in this instance also. You can find more information about delivery and charges on our delivery page.</p><p>6.2 We will contact you to agree a delivery date for your product(s) once you have placed your order and it is confirmed. Our delivery vans visit certain areas on specific days of the week, so your delivery will be arranged for the first available day when we deliver in your area. Please use our postcode checker to find the delivery day for your area. If the product you ordered is out of stock, we will arrange delivery for the next possible delivery day in your area depending on the arrival date of your product.</p><p>6.3 We advertise that we are able to deliver to customers between 1-7 working days, however this is not possible in certain postcode areas. The postcode areas exempt from this service and we advise deliveries will take between 1-14 working days for are:</p><p>AB, DD1-11, DG, EH, FK, G, IV1-63, KA1-26, KW1-14, KY, ML, PA1-38, PA80, PH1-50, NE19, NE48-49, NE61-71, TD, CA, LA, LL15-16, LL20-78, SY17-20, SY23-25, TN 19 -TN 22, TN 28 -TN 29, TN31 - TN40, EX, PL, TQ, TR1-20, TR26-27, BT</p><p>   • We are unfortunately unable to deliver to certain postcodes within the United Kingdom. A full list of these postcodes are: HS, KA27-28, KW15-17, PA41-78, PH41-44,PO30-41, TR21-25, ZE</p><p>6.4 Deliveries usually take place between 7am and 7pm and the drivers will attempt to call you approximately one hour before arrival. We always endeavour to deliver within the agreed time frame and date, however, there are rare occasions when factors outside of our control hinder our ability to do so. These factors include but are not limited to vehicle breakdowns and traffic issues. There may be occasions when our delivery team will therefore arrive earlier or later than the expected time. If rare occurrences like this take place, we will always endeavour to keep you informed.</p><p>6.5 We hold no responsibility for delays outside of our control. If unforeseen circumstances do arise, we will contact you to explain the situation. In the event of long delays, you have the right to cancel your order and receive a full refund for any products paid for and not yet received. In rare circumstances, we may have to cancel your order entirely, in which case we will refund you in full.</p><p>6.6 The buyer will inspect the goods upon delivery and will notify the seller immediately of any damages or shortages. Any damage to the goods should be notified to the seller immediately and signed as damaged on the courier’s paperwork. No claims can be made for any goods signed for as received in good condition. If you, the buyer, fail to comply with this clause the seller will not be held legally liable in any respect of complaint which should have been brought to our attention within the time period stated above.</p><p>6.7 For sofa orders delivered to England, Wales and Scotland, as part of the paid delivery service, we offer assembly at the point of use and this will be carried out by our two-person delivery team. Please choose your room before the delivery team arrives, as they are not contractually bound to move the sofa to another location once the sofa is set up. Please also create a clear path from the entrance to the room of choice to allow our delivery team to operate safely and reduce the chance of damage to the sofa. Our delivery team have been trained to handle and transport furniture carefully, safely and efficiently; and on rare occasions, they hold the right to refuse this service where safety to them or the products are deemed to be at risk.</p><p>6.8 The vast majority of the time we are able to deliver through any standard UK door, however, depending on the product or access route, the product may not fit through an entrance. When this occurs, we will usually take the product back to our warehouse and a member of the sales team will contact you and advise on a product that will be more likely to fit through your entrance.
