Start with the sofa. A modular design is best here, yes you can play around with the size and shape depending on your space and needs. Next, add a couple of armchairs if you can fit them in. If not, pouffes are a great option here as they take up way less room. Finally, create a focal point with a coffee table.. \"<\/p>",

Buying a bench for the end of the bed is a great idea as this gives you somewhere to sit when getting dressed and undressed. It is particularly handy when putting on trousers and socks. It also works well for when you want to sit in the bedroom and talk with someone who may be in bed. <\/p><p>Both stools and benches could be used in the bedroom with a dressing table. Having somewhere to get ready in the morning is desirable in a bedroom and dressing stools allow you to sit at the dressing table while getting ready for the day ahead. <\/p><p><strong>In the Hallway<\/strong><\/p><p>If your hallway is wide enough, it is a great idea to use stools and benches to provide seating for when you want to put on and remove your shoes. A bench seat could also be used to place handbags on or to place the mail before you have a chance to go through it. <\/p><p>If you choose a storage bench or storage stool, you can even keep your shoes or other outdoor wear stored neatly away out of sight. <\/p><p><strong>In the Dining Room<\/strong><\/p><p>The dining room is the perfect place to use stools and benches. If you have a large dining table, particularly an extendable dining table, having additional stools or benches that you can use to seat extra guests is a must. <\/p><p>Having a dining table with bench can be preferable to only using chairs. It’s much easier to seat more people on a bench when you need to create extra place settings for larger gatherings. Using a bench for the dining table can also be a great way to save space. Benches will fit nicely underneath the table out of the way, whereas chairs can only be tucked in so far. <\/p><p><strong>In the Kitchen<\/strong><\/p><p>The kitchen is another room where stools and benches come into their own. Investing in stools for the kitchen is a great idea if you have high cupboards that you cannot reach very well. A stool will give you that added height to be able to reach even the highest shelves. <\/p><p>You may want to invest in stools for a breakfast bar. Being able to sit at this raised counter for light meals, snacks or completing quick admin tasks can be very useful. A popular choice is often bar stools for the kitchen.<\/p><p><strong>In the Bathroom<\/strong><\/p><p>The bathroom is probably the most unexpected room in the home to use stools and benches, but due to their practicality and flexibility they work extremely well in bathrooms too. A stool can be used to provide seating so you can sit down while you watch the kids who are enjoying their bath time. Or it can act as a perch for your partner so you can share details about your day while they sit beside you while you soak.<\/p><p>A small stool could also be used as a surface to place your toiletries on next to the bath, making it easier to reach the products that you need while you bathe. If you’re trying to create a spa-like vibe you could also place rolled up towels on stools and benches. <\/p><p>A bench is also a useful addition for placing your clothes on once you have undressed ready to take a bath or shower.<\/p><p>Stools and benches can have many uses around the home. These flexible and versatile pieces of furniture are a great investment. <\/p><p>If you’ve bought stools or benches from Honeypot Furniture we’d love to see.
